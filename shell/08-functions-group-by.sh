# grouping
# an essential part of aggregation is grouping. That is, in addition to computing 
# aggregates over an entire result, you can also split that result into groups of 
# rows with like values and compute aggregates on each groupâ€”all in one step.

echo
# count the number of found found by season
sqlite3 foods.db <<!
.header on
.mode column
select season, count(*) from episodes group by season;

echo
# count the number of found found by season (expluding `null` season)
sqlite3 foods.db <<!
.header on
.mode column
select season, count(*) from episodes where season not null group by season;
